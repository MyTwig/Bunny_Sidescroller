public class EnemyBase : MonoBehaviour
{
    //Stubbed for now

    //The enemies will need to move around on the screen based on their type, but I'd like to have something I can plug in

    //All enemies will need an attack pattern too, which would be nice to slot in

    //Finally we'll need a health stat or something, I'll have to figure out whether i want to go by number of hits or utilize an HP bar.
